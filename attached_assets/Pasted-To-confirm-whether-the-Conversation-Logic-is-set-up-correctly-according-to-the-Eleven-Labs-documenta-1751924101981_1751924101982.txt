To confirm whether the Conversation Logic is set up correctly according to the Eleven Labs documentation, we can review key aspects of your existing implementation in use-elevenlabs-voice-agent.ts and related files.

Key Aspects to Check
WebSocket Connection: Ensure the WebSocket connection is established correctly by retrieving the signed URL and connecting as shown in your implementation:

The signed URL is being fetched from your server via an API endpoint. Make sure this is configured correctly.
After obtaining the URL, make sure you create the WebSocket connection and handle its events (open, message, error, close).
Sending Initialization Message: Confirm that an initial message is sent upon connecting to the WebSocket, which starts the conversation:

In your code, you send an object like {"type": "conversation_initiation_client_data"}. Ensure this matches the required format specified in the documentation.
Handling Incoming Messages: Review how incoming messages are processed:

You are logging received messages and handling specific message types such as agent_response, audio, and interruption. Make sure all required types are handled properly.
Generating Speech with Timestamps: Confirm that you are generating speech using the ElevenLabs API with timestamps:

Ensure you are using the /api/elevenlabs/speech-with-timestamps endpoint correctly to generate audio with timestamps, as highlighted in your use-elevenlabs-conversational-ai.ts file.
Audio Playback and Viseme Handling: Check that audio playback and viseme updates are synchronized:

The audio URL retrieved from the server should be played and the corresponding viseme animations should be triggered at the correct timestamps.
Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling is implemented for WebSocket connection and message processing, as seen in your useElevenLabsVoiceAgent hook.

Summary of Expectations
Verify the information in your server routes to make sure the ElevenLabs signed URL and speech timestamp endpoints are functioning properly.
Ensure event listeners for the WebSocket connection include robust handling for various message types you might receive.
Make sure your callback functions (like viseme updates) are correctly utilized in the state management of your component.
If you find inconsistencies with the documentation or functionality not working as expected, adjustments can be made based on these checks. Feel free to ask for code modifications or clarifications if you need specific parts revised!
